# Bhoomi Mitra 🌱

An AI-powered platform revolutionizing agriculture by providing farmers with real-time disease detection, market analytics, weather insights, and subsidy assistance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers in India face challenges like slow disease detection, unpredictable market prices, unreliable weather forecasts, and complex subsidy applications. Traditional farming advice lacks personalization, failing to consider soil health, regional climate, and specific crop needs. Limited real-time insights and multilingual AI support further hinder decision-making.

Bhoomi Mitra integrates AI-driven disease detection, market analytics, weather insights, personalized crop planning, and a seamless subsidy checker, empowering farmers with data-driven solutions to improve efficiency and agricultural outcomes.
